# JaDraw

My C++ software graphics library for drawing to a bitmap. Good for embedded devices.

This gives functions that let you draw to a given bitmap. How to display the resulting image is up to your specific application.

It's inspired by [Olive.c](https://tsoding.github.io/olive.c/) and [Adafruit GFX Library](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-gfx-graphics-library/overview). They each have certain quirks I don't like and drawing functions I want but they don't have, so I made my own.
